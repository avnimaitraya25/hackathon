Statement number 43 
Title - Student Innovation (Miscellaneous)
So Basically we were already working on a food delivery website before whose work was to deliver the food items.But now we are thinking to make it a collaborative website which will further colab with many websites or online sites to provide the food aur necesaary food supplies as early as possible.
This is a collaborative user interface webpage that we are trying to design.
Basically we'll try to colab with big industry webistes like blinkit or amazon fresh,and the website will provide the user the best option available in their city.
Tha main goal of this project is to reduce time wastage and to ensure the best and safe delivery possible in today's world.
we had already designed the user interface of the webpage
Now we will attach it with other websites in the form of collaboration.
